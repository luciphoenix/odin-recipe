        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Fufu and Light Soup is a traditional Ghanaian delicacy. Fufu, made
          from cassava and plantains (or yams), is soft and stretchy, pairing
          perfectly with the rich and flavorful light soup. The soup is often
          prepared with meat or fish, tomatoes, and spices, making it a
          comforting and hearty dish.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and boil cassava and plantains: Wash, peel, and cut the cassava and
        plantains into smaller pieces. Boil them together in a pot with water

      <li>
        Pound the fufu: Using a wooden mortar and pestle, pound the cassava and
        plantains together until they form a smooth and stretchy dough. Keep
        turning the mixture with wet hands to ensure even consistency.
        <ul>
          <li>
            For fufu flour: Mix the flour with water and stir continuously over
            low heat until it thickens and becomes stretchy.
