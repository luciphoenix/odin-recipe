        <p class="text">
          Red Red is a hearty and flavorful dish made with black-eyed peas or
          cowpeas cooked in red palm oil and paired with fried ripe plantains.
          The dish gets its name from the red hue of the palm oil and the
          plantains. Itâ€™s vegetarian-friendly and packed with protein, making it
          both nutritious and delicious.
