              <h2>FUFU & LIGHT SOUP</h2>
              <p class="text">
                Fufu and Light Soup is a traditional Ghanaian delicacy. Fufu,
                made from cassava and plantains (or yams), is soft and stretchy,
                pairing perfectly with the rich and flavorful light soup. The
                soup is often prepared with meat or fish, tomatoes, and spices,
                making it a comforting and hearty dish.

              <h2>RED RED</h2>
              <p class="text">
                Red Red is a hearty and flavorful dish made with black-eyed peas
                or cowpeas cooked in red palm oil and paired with fried ripe
                plantains. The dish gets its name from the red hue of the palm
                oil and the plantains. Itâ€™s vegetarian-friendly and packed with
                protein, making it both nutritious and delicious.
